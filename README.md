# Reasoning About the Things that Go Unsaid

## 9.66 Final Project

In human conversations, human listeners reason not only about the utterances they hear but also about the alternative utterances that go unsaid. For example Figure 1 outlines how humans reason about utterances and alternatives. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) is the framework for pragmatic reasoning that provides a way to formalize inferences about meaning in context [2] like our example in Figure 1. There have been multiple theories that propose alternatives are derived at the level of concepts and others propose they are derived at the help of linguistic expression. In our project, we plan to use reference games to explore when alternatives are conceptually but not linguistically accessible.

_Figure 1: An example of 3 images where the second image is the target [1]. If the speaker says “glasses” the listener can assume that the speaker is talking about the second image because, despite images 2 and 3 both having glasses, the listener can infer that the speaker would have said “hat” if they wanted to describe image 3. This is an example of scalar implicature._

To answer this question, we have outlined tasks we plan on completing:

- Read related works involving RSA
- Design and launch experiment
- Design and implement the RSA model
- Analyze data and compare data to model predictions
